# Programming (Computer Science) Study Pathway

I majored in electrical engineering for my bachelor's degree. However, I'm currently working in a heavily computer-science related area. At first, I just wrote codes randomly and learned lessons heuristically during the process. Although my skills improved, I felt I was wandering. One day, I figured out that I needed to receive a well-structured education in computer science. Thankfully, there are heaps of excellent materials on the web from both academia and industry. I organized my own curriculum and started to teach myself. Unlike other currated lists of computer science courses, I tried to boil the online courses down to match one of curriculums of MIT and UC Berkeley.

## The Curriculum
I followed the MIT curriculum and replaced the courses that are not provided at OCW with similar UCB courses.
